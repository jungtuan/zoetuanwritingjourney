	<h2>Pink Ink (2017)</h2>
	<h3>“Our youth is like a pink container with black ink inside—we can neither shine nor stay dark completely”</h3>
	<p>My first book, <i>Pink Ink</i>, was published by Zebra Crossing Publishing Co. It was a collection of poems that I wrote in high school. In this book, I described the color of youth as being both pink and black. Pink refers to the love and romance we experienced and pursued in our young ages, and black refers to the doubt and confusion we had towards the adult world.

	<h2>Keep The Secret (2018)</h2>
	<h3>“Saying goodbye only hurts one person until love is involved”</h3>
	<p><i>Keep The Secret</i> was published in May 2018, the summer after my first year of college, by Unitas Publishing Co. I started writing this book in summer 2017, when I just graduated from high school and was about to go to the United States for college. Being the first person from my family that studies abroad, I wrote poems to express my anxiety, fear, homesickness, as well as joy and excitement for this brand new journey of life.

	<h2>Tone Deaf (2019)</h2>
	<h3>“Don’t be afraid if you are always playing a different song— that is because you have your own tune”</h3>
	<p><i>Tone Deaf</i> is my latest work. I selected 47 songs that are meaningful to me and used their lyrics as the basis for poem and prose creation. The topics cover love and romance, social observations, insights for life, and reminiscence of the past. The book was named <i>“Tone Deaf”</i> because I was trying to convey the idea that even though one is not good at music (like me), they can still find their own way to communicate with the world—just like how I use writing to speak my voice.
